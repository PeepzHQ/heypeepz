# Chat Transcript - Tab 1

Just chatting, no need to code.

I need help for a calculation.

When a person on a social network has more followings than followers, that feels shameful, right?

Would there be a ratio method? How that would work?
FollowersXFollowings ratio.

Please tell some examples, too, even using famous people or influencer/spammy accounts following more than being followed.

Certainly! The ratio of followers to followings can indeed provide insights into the nature of a social media account. This ratio is often used to gauge the popularity or influence of an account. A higher ratio indicates that more people follow the account than it follows others, which is typically seen as a sign of influence or popularity.

### Ratio Calculation
The ratio can be calculated simply as:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Followers}}{\text{Followings}} \]

### Examples
1. **Influential Account**: Suppose an influencer has 100,000 followers but follows only 500 people. The ratio would be:
   \[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{100,000}{500} = 200 \]
   This high ratio suggests a high level of influence or celebrity status.

2. **Average User**: A regular user might have 300 followers and follows 300 people. The ratio would be:
   \[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{300}{300} = 1 \]
   This balanced ratio indicates a typical user who follows as many people as follow them.

3. **Spammy or Less Influential Account**: A spammy account might follow 5,000 people but only have 100 followers. The ratio would be:
   \[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{100}{5,000} = 0.02 \]
   This low ratio often indicates an account that follows many others in hopes of being followed back, which is common in spam or bot-like behaviors.

### Interpretation
- **High Ratio (>1)**: Indicates more followers than followings, suggesting influence or popularity.
- **Ratio = 1**: Balanced following and followers, typical for regular users.
- **Low Ratio (<1)**: More followings than followers, which might suggest a newer account, less influence, or spammy behavior.

This ratio can be a useful metric for quickly assessing the nature of a social media account.

Thank you!

Please now implement that on Hey/Peepz (this codebase), telling on the profile sidebar, on the part that shows Followers+Followings, what is the ratio!

@AIMAP.txt file will help you understand where to find anything on such a large codebase.

## AI (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09):

To implement the display of the followers-to-followings ratio on the profile sidebar in the Hey/Peepz codebase, you can modify the `Followerings` component located in `apps/web/src/components/Profile/Followerings.tsx`. Here's how you can add the ratio calculation and display it alongside the existing followers and followings counts.

### Updated `Followerings.tsx` Component

```typescript:apps/web/src/components/Profile/Followerings.tsx
import type { Profile } from '@hey/lens';
import type { FC } from 'react';

import getProfile from '@hey/helpers/getProfile';
import humanize from '@hey/helpers/humanize';
import { H4, Text } from '@hey/ui';
import Link from 'next/link';
import plur from 'plur';

interface FolloweringsProps {
  profile: Profile;
}

const Followerings: FC<FolloweringsProps> = ({ profile }) => {
  const profileLink = getProfile(profile).link;
  const { followers, following } = profile.stats;

  // Calculate the followers-to-followings ratio
  const ratio = following > 0 ? (followers / following).toFixed(2) : 'N/A';

  return (
    <div className="flex gap-8">
      <Link
        className="text-left outline-offset-4"
        href={`${profileLink}/following`}
      >
        <H4>{humanize(following)}</H4>
        <div className="ld-text-gray-500">Following</div>
      </Link>
      <Link
        className="text-left outline-offset-4"
        href={`${profileLink}/followers`}
      >
        <H4>{humanize(followers)}</H4>
        <div className="ld-text-gray-500">{plur('Follower', followers)}</div>
      </Link>
      <div className="text-center">
        <Text className="text-lg font-semibold">Ratio: {ratio}</Text>
        <div className="ld-text-gray-500">Followers/Following</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Followerings;
```

### Explanation

1. **Ratio Calculation**: The ratio of followers to followings is calculated using the formula `followers / following`. If the number of followings is zero, it displays 'N/A' to avoid division by zero errors.
2. **Display**: The ratio is displayed in a new `div` element styled similarly to the followers and followings links. It uses the `Text` component from `@hey/ui` for consistent styling.
3. **Humanization**: The `humanize` function is used to format the numbers nicely, and `plur` is used to handle pluralization of the word "follower".

This modification will show the ratio on the profile sidebar, providing users with a quick insight into the profile's social reach compared to its activity.
