## User:

Thank you!

Issue: adding an IPFS CID/URL to a field doesn't make the "Save" button clickable, unlike all others. When I as a workaround change other fields (such as display name) to make the Save button clickable, my avatar isn't changed to the IPFS URL, which means the Save button didn't submit the new avatar/cover.

The error you're encountering is due to the `ChooseFile` component not accepting an `id` prop, as defined in its props interface. The `ChooseFile` component generates its own `id` using the `useId` hook and does not expect an `id` to be passed as a prop.

To resolve this issue, you should remove the `id` prop from the `ChooseFile` component usage in your `ProfileSettingsForm` component. Here's how you can adjust the code:

```typescript:apps/web/src/components/Settings/Profile/Profile.tsx
422|          <div className="space-y-2">
423|            <div className="label">Avatar</div>
424|            <div className="flex items-center space-x-3">
425|              <ChooseFile
426|                onChange={(evt: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) =>
427|                  onFileChange(evt, 'avatar')
428|                }
429|              />
430|              <Input
431|                id="avatarIPFS"
432|                onChange={(e) => setAvatarIPFS(e.target.value)}
433|                placeholder="IPFS CID for avatar"
434|                type="text"
435|                value={avatarIPFS}
436|              />
437|            </div>
438|          </div>
```

This change should resolve the compilation error. Make sure to apply a similar fix for any other instances where you might be incorrectly passing an `id` prop to the `ChooseFile` component.

To address the issue where the "Save" button does not become clickable when only the IPFS CID/URL fields are updated, and to ensure that the new avatar/cover IPFS URLs are submitted correctly, you need to make a few adjustments:

1. **Update Form State on IPFS CID/URL Change**: Ensure that the form state is updated when the IPFS CID/URL fields are changed. This will make the "Save" button responsive to changes in these fields.

2. **Ensure IPFS URLs are Included in the Submission**: Verify that the IPFS URLs are correctly included in the data submitted when the "Save" button is clicked.

Here's how you can implement these changes:

### 1. Update Form State on IPFS CID/URL Change

You need to ensure that changing the IPFS CID/URL fields updates the form state. This can typically be done by using a form management library like `react-hook-form` or by manually triggering a state update that the "Save" button checks.

Assuming you are using a form state management like `useZodForm` from your existing setup, you might need to manually trigger a state update. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```typescript
// Assuming `form` is your form instance from useZodForm
const handleIPFSChange = (value: string, field: 'avatarIPFS' | 'coverIPFS') => {
  const newValues = { ...form.getValues(), [field]: value };
  form.setValue(field, value); // Update the specific field
  // Optionally trigger validation or other side effects
};

// Update your Input component for IPFS fields
<Input
  id="avatarIPFS"
  onChange={(e) => handleIPFSChange(e.target.value, 'avatarIPFS')}
  placeholder="IPFS CID for avatar"
  type="text"
  value={avatarIPFS}
/>

<Input
  id="coverIPFS"
  onChange={(e) => handleIPFSChange(e.target.value, 'coverIPFS')}
  placeholder="IPFS CID for cover"
  type="text"
  value={coverIPFS}
/>
```

### 2. Ensure IPFS URLs are Included in the Submission

When the "Save" button is clicked, ensure that the IPFS URLs are part of the data being submitted. This might involve adjusting how you construct the request payload in your `editProfile` or similar function:

```typescript
const editProfile = async (data: FormData) => {
  // Construct the profile update payload
  const payload = {
    ...data,
    avatar: avatarIPFS, // Ensure the avatar IPFS URL is included
    cover: coverIPFS // Ensure the cover IPFS URL is included
  };

  // Call the API or handle the submission logic
  await updateProfile(payload);
};
```

Make sure that the `updateProfile` function or similar is correctly handling these fields and that they are included in any API requests or state updates.

### Debugging Tips

- **Log Outputs**: Add console logs at critical points (e.g., right before submission) to ensure that the data is as expected.
- **Form State Management**: If using a library like `react-hook-form`, ensure that all fields are registered and that updates to any field trigger re-renders as expected.

These changes should help make the "Save" button responsive to changes in the IPFS CID/URL fields and ensure that these URLs are submitted correctly.
