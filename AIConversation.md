## User:

Where are this social networks' Bookmarks stored?

In an external server, or using NextJS?

## AI (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09):

The bookmarks in this social network are managed through interactions with an external server, specifically using GraphQL queries to a service that likely represents a backend server handling the Lens Protocol. This is evident from the use of GraphQL queries to fetch and manage bookmark data.

For instance, the `Feed` component in the `Bookmarks` directory uses a GraphQL query to fetch bookmarked publications. This is set up in the `usePublicationBookmarksQuery` hook, which is configured with a GraphQL query defined in the `PublicationBookmarks.graphql` file. The query fetches data based on a `PublicationBookmarksRequest`, which includes parameters like `limit` and `where` conditions that filter the publications based on their metadata.

Here are the relevant code references:

- **GraphQL Query Setup**:

```1:21:packages/lens/documents/queries/PublicationBookmarks.graphql
query PublicationBookmarks($request: PublicationBookmarksRequest!) {
  publicationBookmarks(request: $request) {
    items {
      ... on Post {
        ...PostFields
      }
      ... on Comment {
        ...CommentFields
      }
      ... on Mirror {
        ...MirrorFields
      }
      ... on Quote {
        ...QuoteFields
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      next
    }
  }
}
```

- **Usage of GraphQL Query in Feed Component**:

```12:115:apps/web/src/components/Bookmarks/Feed.tsx
import { LimitType, usePublicationBookmarksQuery } from '@hey/lens';
import { Card, EmptyState, ErrorMessage } from '@hey/ui';
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Virtuoso } from 'react-virtuoso';
import { useImpressionsStore } from 'src/store/non-persisted/useImpressionsStore';
import { useTipsStore } from 'src/store/non-persisted/useTipsStore';

let virtuosoState: any = { ranges: [], screenTop: 0 };

interface FeedProps {
  focus?: PublicationMetadataMainFocusType;
}

const Feed: FC<FeedProps> = ({ focus }) => {
  const { fetchAndStoreViews } = useImpressionsStore();
  const { fetchAndStoreTips } = useTipsStore();
  const virtuoso = useRef<VirtuosoHandle>(null);

  const request: PublicationBookmarksRequest = {
    limit: LimitType.TwentyFive,
    where: { metadata: { ...(focus && { mainContentFocus: [focus] }) } }
  };

  const { data, error, fetchMore, loading } = usePublicationBookmarksQuery({
    onCompleted: async ({ publicationBookmarks }) => {
      const ids =
        publicationBookmarks?.items?.map((p) => {
          return p.__typename === 'Mirror' ? p.mirrorOn?.id : p.id;
        }) || [];
      await fetchAndStoreViews(ids);
      await fetchAndStoreTips(ids);
    },
    variables: { request }
  });

  const publications = data?.publicationBookmarks?.items;
  const pageInfo = data?.publicationBookmarks?.pageInfo;
  const hasMore = pageInfo?.next;

  const onScrolling = (scrolling: boolean) => {
    if (!scrolling) {
      virtuoso?.current?.getState((state: StateSnapshot) => {
        virtuosoState = { ...state };
      });
    }
  };

  const onEndReached = async () => {
    if (hasMore) {
      const { data } = await fetchMore({
        variables: { request: { ...request, cursor: pageInfo?.next } }
      });
      const ids =
        data?.publicationBookmarks?.items?.map((p) => {
          return p.__typename === 'Mirror' ? p.mirrorOn?.id : p.id;
        }) || [];
      await fetchAndStoreViews(ids);
      await fetchAndStoreTips(ids);
    }
  };
  if (loading) {
    return <PublicationsShimmer />;
  }

  if (publications?.length === 0) {
    return (
      <EmptyState
        icon={<BookmarkIcon className="size-8" />}
        message="No bookmarks yet!"
      />
    );
  }

  if (error) {
    return <ErrorMessage error={error} title="Failed to load bookmark feed" />;
  }

  return (
    <Card>
      <Virtuoso
        className="virtual-divider-list-window"
        computeItemKey={(index, publication) => `${publication.id}-${index}`}
        data={publications}
        endReached={onEndReached}
        isScrolling={onScrolling}
        itemContent={(index, publication) => (
          <SinglePublication
            isFirst={index === 0}
            isLast={index === (publications?.length || 0) - 1}
            publication={publication as AnyPublication}
          />
        )}
        ref={virtuoso}
        restoreStateFrom={
          virtuosoState.ranges.length === 0
            ? virtuosoState?.current?.getState((state: StateSnapshot) => state)
            : virtuosoState
        }
        useWindowScroll
      />
    </Card>
  );
};
```

This setup indicates that the bookmarks are not stored locally or managed directly within the Next.js application but are instead handled by an external service through API calls.

Please also detail why each service (such as S3) are required for what; write to AIMAP too.

## AI (claude-3.5-sonnet):

Certainly! I'll add the Docker installation commands and explain the purpose of each service to the AIMAP.md file. Here's the content to be added:

## Docker Installation and Setup

To install Docker and Docker Compose, use the following commands:

1. Install Docker:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
````

2. Install Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. Start Docker services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## External Services and Their Purposes

1. **PostgreSQL**:

   - Purpose: Main database for storing user data, posts, and other application-specific information.
   - Usage: Stores persistent data that needs to be queried and updated frequently.
   - Configuration: See the `docker-compose.yml` file for setup details.

2. **Redis**:

   - Purpose: In-memory data store used for caching and temporary data storage.
   - Usage: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data and managing session information.
   - Configuration: See the `docker-compose.yml` file for setup details.

3. **ClickHouse**:

   - Purpose: Analytics database for event tracking and data analysis.
   - Usage: Stores and processes large volumes of event data for user behavior analysis and reporting.
   - Configuration: See the `docker-compose.yml` file for setup details.

4. **S3 (or compatible object storage)**:

   - Purpose: Stores user-generated content like images and other media files.
   - Usage: Provides scalable and reliable storage for user uploads and other static assets.
   - Configuration: Set up in the `.env.local` file with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_EVER_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_EVER_ENDPOINT` variables.

5. **Momoka**:

   - Purpose: Data availability layer for off-chain content.
   - Usage: Enables faster and cheaper transactions by storing some data off-chain while maintaining verifiability.
   - Configuration: Integrated through the Lens Protocol; check `packages/lens` for related queries and mutations.

6. **Ethereum nodes**:

   - Purpose: For blockchain interactions such as contract calls and transaction signing.
   - Usage: Enables interaction with the Ethereum blockchain for features like profile creation, following, and other on-chain actions.
   - Configuration: Set up in the `.env.local` file with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_ID` variables.

7. **Lens Protocol API**:

   - Purpose: Core protocol for social graph and content management.
   - Usage: Provides the foundation for decentralized social networking features.
   - Configuration: Set up in the `.env.local` file with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_LENS_API_URL` variable.
