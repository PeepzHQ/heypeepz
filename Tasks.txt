- From Upstream: fetch, solve conflicts, merge https://github.com/danimesq/heypeepz/pull/2
- wait for cursor-chat-export to be fixed

-

- best PR possible upstream: PWA support https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/pwa-minimal-requirements
- next PR then: on a reply, above Hey will show to what post it is replying to (as in Twitter and others)
- then another next PR: - "Threads" tab on user profile (a Thread is a root post that has a dept of 2 sequential replies from OP)
- then another next PRÂ²: current covers will be considered mobile (bc portrait will be the future as phones overtook desktop), while the desktop category will be supported only on Lens
-
- this upstream PR is slated for failure, but let's try: - set Farcaster, Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon profiles!

- Peepz-exclusive feature: Luck of the Day (add to a file separating what features should be removed later, bc this feature should appear only on Ogurt)
- understand how Hey/Peepz sends data to be posted, so make this feature: profile backgrounds! (from either file or IPFS)

(these will also be added to a file, telling these should be removed once Peepz sets up its own CDN to work like Hey)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
was still being implemented, have to complement [I MEAN, THESE ARE INCOMPLETE]:
- Tell abt another type of ratio: when an answer have more likes than the root post ; show a "percent until ratio", which will come as "% ratioed", only when it reach 50% ; what post to test the 50% ratio: https://web-jv1mlfku0-heyxyz.vercel.app/posts/0x04e14d-0x10-DA-0157d38e ; Notify OP when a reply has 50% and 100% ratioed (first, understand how the codebase handles notifications on Lens)
- Add/Update avatar/cover via IPFS CID text inputs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- set profile pic from IPFS! button on settings on the right side of the "Choose" file button in the "Avatar" heading ; can do the same for Cover

- on "Setup your Peepz profile", show this on profile too, with a progressbar

- Hero.tsx: incentivize to use Trust Wallet's Swift (but first fix issue by asking support team why I can't create my own)
