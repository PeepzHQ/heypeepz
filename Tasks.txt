- PWA support https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/pwa-minimal-requirements

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
was still being implemented, have to complement the latest commits:
- Tell abt another type of ratio: when an answer have more likes than the root post
-
show a "percent until ratio", which will come as "% ratioed", only when it reach 50%
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what post to test the 50% ratio: https://web-jv1mlfku0-heyxyz.vercel.app/posts/0x04e14d-0x10-DA-0157d38e
where to test Peepz: https://github.com/heyxyz/hey/pull/5244

- set Farcaster, Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon and Peepeth profiles!
- set profile pic from IPFS! button on settings on the right side of the "Choose" file button in the "Avatar" heading ; can do the same for Cover
- understand how Hey/Peepz sends data to be posted, so make this feature: profile backgrounds! (from either file or IPFS)
- understand how Hey/Peepz sends data to be posted, so make a diff for covers: classic (horizontal), portrait

- "Threads" tab on user profile (a Thread is a root post that has a dept of 2 sequential replies from OP)

Notify OP when a reply has 50% and 100% ratioed (first, understand how the codebase handles notifications on Lens)

- on "Setup your Peepz profile", show this on profile too, with a progressbar

- Hero.tsx: incentivize to use Trust Wallet's Swift
